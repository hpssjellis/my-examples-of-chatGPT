 When the term "Keyfreemusic Notation" is a shorthand that can be used to simplify switching the musical key of any song. 
    If the music was written in the key of C then the root note C becomes [0] the next note C# becomes [1]
    and the next note D becomes [2] etc etc until the note A# which becomes the single digit [@] and note B becomes [*]
      
    For any higher octaves than the root octave a single quote ' is placed infront of the notes and if the note is from an even higher 
    octave then another ' is placed before the note.  

    For any lower octaves than the root octave a single comma , is placed infront of the notes and if the note is from an even lower 
    octave then another , is placed before the note.
    
    When formatting the musical score is complete print the entire results within one set of square brackets. Right now just indicated if you understand keyfreemusic notation.
    
    Notes that last for a long durection can have one or 2 underscore characters after them. 
    For example ,C_  would be a long lower C note.  D'__ would be a very long upper D note
    
    Here is a longer example: Twinkle Twinkle Little star Normal displayed as [C, C, G, G, A, A, G, F, F, E, E, D, D, C, G, G, F, F, E, E, D]
    becomes in keyfreemusic format:

    REMEMBER: keyfreemusic notation does not need commas or spaces between notes!
I understand Keyfreemusic notation. It is a system for representing musical notes and pitches in a compact and easily readable form. It involves assigning numerical values to each pitch, and using various symbols to indicate octave, duration, and other aspects of the music. Keyfreemusic notation can be useful for quickly transposing a piece of music to a different key, as well as for organizing and storing musical scores in a compact form.

Please write a 20 note song in Keyfreemusic notation and regular notation
Sure! Here is a simple song in Keyfreemusic notation and standard notation:

Keyfreemusic notation: [0077997_5544220__7755442__]
Standard notation: C, C, G, G, A, A, G, F, F, E, E, D, D, C, G, G, F, F, E, E, D

This is the melody to the children's song "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star." In Keyfreemusic notation, each number represents a pitch, with 0 being C, 1 being C#, and so on. The underscores represent longer note durations. In standard notation, the pitches are represented by their letter names and the durations are indicated by the length of the notes.

Here is another example of a song in Keyfreemusic notation and standard notation:

Keyfreemusic notation: [0123456'01234567']
Standard notation: C#, D, E, F#, G, A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A, B, C#

This is the melody to the song "Do-Re-Mi" from The Sound of Music. In Keyfreemusic notation, the single quotes indicate that the notes are in a higher octave than the root octave. In standard notation, the octave is indicated by the placement of the notes on the staff.

That is excellent. Can you do the same for a few short songs that have a greater octave range
Certainly! Here are two more songs in Keyfreemusic notation and standard notation, with a wider range of octaves:

"Mary Had a Little Lamb"
Keyfreemusic notation: [007777770_333222110077777_33322211]
Standard notation: C, C, G, G, G, G, G, E, E, E, D, D, D, C, C, G, G, G, G, G, E, E, E, D, D, D

"Jingle Bells"
Keyfreemusic notation: [0@1@22''1@2''2@0_0@1@22''1@2''2@0]
Standard notation: C, D, D, E, E, D, E, D, C, C, D, D, E, E, D, E, D

In both of these songs, the double quotes in the Keyfreemusic notation indicate notes in an octave higher than the root octave, while in standard notation the octave is indicated by the placement of the notes on the staff. I hope these examples are helpful! Let me know if you have any questions.
