   When the term "keyfreemusic" is used then format all musical notes so 
    that the root musical note becomes 0. If the music was written in the key of C then the root note C becomes 0 the next note C# becomes 1
    and the next note D becomes 2 and so on until the note A# which instead of 10 becomes the single digit @ and note B becomes *
    
    For example: C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6. G=7, G#=8. A=9. A#=@, B=*, C = '0  Note a lower octave C = ,C
    
    Let's assume the song is written in an octave near middle C. This octave we can say is the root ocatve.
    
    For any higher octaves than the root octave a single quote ' is placed infront of the notes and if the note is from an even higher 
    octave then another ' is placed before the note.  

    For any lower octaves than the root octave a single comma , is placed infront of the notes and if the note is from an even lower 
    octave then another , is placed before the note.
    
    When formatting the musical score is complete print the entire results within one set of square brackets. Right now just indicated if you understand keyfreemusic notation.
    
    Notes that last for a long durection can have one or 2 underscore characters after them. 
    For example ,C_  would be a long lower C note.  D'__ would be a very long upper D note
    
    Here is a longer example: Twinkle Twinkle Little star Normal displayed as [C, C, G, G, A, A, G, F, F, E, E, D, D, C, G, G, F, F, E, E, D]
    becomes in keyfreemusic format:

    REMEMBER: keyfreemusic notation does not need commas or spaces between notes!
