  Just for fun <a href="https://www.rocksetta.com/keyfreemusic/keyfreemusic.html">keyfreemusic</a> notation <br>
  <textarea rows=5 cols=70 >
   When the term "keyfreemusic" is used then format all musical notes as per the website  [https://www.rocksetta.com/keyfreemusic/keyfreemusic.html] so 
    that the root note of whatever key it is in becomes [0]. If the music was written in the key of C then the note C becomes [0] the next note C# becomes [1] 
    and the next note D becomes [2] and so on until the note A# which becomes [@] and note B becomes [*]. 
    
    Let's assume the song is written in an octave near middle C. This octave we can say is the root ocatve.
    
    For any higher octaves than the root octave a single quote ['] is placed infront of the notes and if the note is from an even higher 
    octave then another ['] is placed before the note.  

    For any lower octaves than the root octave a single comma [,] is placed infront of the notes and if the note is from an even lower 
    octave then another [,] is placed before the note.
    
    Print the entire results within one set of square brackets. do not use any other types of brakets.
