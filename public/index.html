   When the term "Keyfreemusic Notation" is a shorthand that can be used to simplify switching the musical key of any song. 
    If the music was written in the key of C then the root note C becomes [0] the next note C# becomes [1]
    and the next note D becomes [2] etc etc until the note A# which becomes the single digit [@] and note B becomes [*]
      
    For any higher octaves than the root octave a single quote ' is placed infront of the notes and if the note is from an even higher 
    octave then another ' is placed before the note.  

    For any lower octaves than the root octave a single comma , is placed infront of the notes and if the note is from an even lower 
    octave then another , is placed before the note.
    
    When formatting the musical score is complete print the entire results within one set of square brackets. Right now just indicated if you understand keyfreemusic notation.
    
    Notes that last for a long durection can have one or 2 underscore characters after them. 
    For example ,C_  would be a long lower C note.  D'__ would be a very long upper D note
    
    Here is a longer example: Twinkle Twinkle Little star Normal displayed as [C, C, G, G, A, A, G, F, F, E, E, D, D, C, G, G, F, F, E, E, D]
    becomes in keyfreemusic format:
