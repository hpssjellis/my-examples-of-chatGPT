 FAIL   

Draft in progress

v1
Write a single webpage javascript program that takes grayscale 320 by 320 PNG images from the computer disk and trains a tensorflowjs vision machine learning model and saves the compiled model to disk.

v2
Write a single vanilla webpage javascript program with all  local variables starting with "my"  that takes grayscale 320 by 320 PNG images from the computer disk and trains a tensorflowjs vision machine learning model trained on the label "laundry" in all the images and saves the compiled model to disk. It then uses the webcam and a canvas to classify if the webcam sees the label.

v6
Write a self contained HTML page with vanilla javascript where all  local variables start with "my"  that takes several grayscale 320 by 320 PNG images of laundry from the computer disk and trains a tensorflowjs vision machine learning model with the labell "laundry" and saves the compiled model to disk. It then uses the webcam and a canvas to classify if the webcam images can be classified as Laundry

v7
Write a self contained HTML page with vanilla javascript where all  local variables start with "my"  that takes several grayscale 320 by 320 PNG images of laundry from the computer disk and trains on  tensorflowjs version 4.1.0 a vision machine learning model with the label "laundry" and saves the compiled model to disk. 



Trying again

v01
Write a single html page that uses vanilla javascript  and uploads  grayscale 320 by 320 PNG images from the computer disk and trains a version 4.1.0 tensorflowjs vision machine learning model and saves the compiled model to disk.
